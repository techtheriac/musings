### Self referential vs Funtional design
- **Self** **referential** design is only where the designer understands.
- **Pragmatic** design is where the user understands.

ðŸ“Œ *Design is the intermediary between infromation and understanding.*

- Data - are incomplete, do not reveal meaning because of lack of form or misleading relationship within them.
- Designer - The designer is unable to understand the meaning of - and therefore unable to distill and visualize the data. The designer is not able to model the needs of the audience as he is not inherently aware of human factors off the bat. Designer might be compelled to present visually stunning graphic which might be counter intuitive.
- Audience - Might not be able to decipher information because of lack of visual literacy or education.

ðŸ“Œ *Indifference toward people and reality in which they live in is actually the one and oly cardinal sin in design*
