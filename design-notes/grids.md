## The Process (Bullet points)

- A grid should focus on problem solving first and aesthetics second.
- A grid is a component of user experience: i.e it is a framework within which the user can control his experience.
- The simpler the grid, the more efficient it is.

### Steps

- Research the requirements
- Wireframes
- Preparatory design
  - Pencil sketches
  - Units, columns, baseline development and calculations
  - Page Sketches
- Comps
- Production (code)

### Research

Constraints to be on the lookout for includes:

- Technical Constraints: Here the delivery of the design solution is determined. These includes the target screen resolution, nature of browser (rendering platform).
- Business Constraints: Determines the very purpose of the design solution i.e to increase user traffic or whatever ðŸ˜Ž. Brand positioning is also put into consideration. Businesses ability to maintain solution provided should also be considered.
- Content and editorial constraints:

### Grids

- A typical grid system has 16 columns where designated screen width might be 960px.
- Baseline Grid is the invisible line on which letter forms rest.
- Human eyes most comfortably reads 60 to 80 character per line.
