# Part 1 - Design principles

### Design Process

- Design is the planning of arrangement elements to form a visual pattern.

### Unity

### Emphasis and Focal Point

### Scale and proportion

### Balance

### Rhythm

## Color Theory

- Color is a property of light, not an object itself
- Objects have no color of their own but rather the ability to reflect certian wavelengths of light.
- Black absorbs all wavelengths; white reflects all of them; blue objects absorb all the wavelengths except the blue ones.
- Thus, as light changes, color changes.
- Rays of light are direct light, whereas the color of paint is reflected light.
- Color from light combine and form new visual sensations based on what is called <b>additive system</b>
- Pigments combine in the subtractive system.

### Properties Of Colors.

- Hue describes the different sensation of different parts of the color spectrum.
- <b>Value</b> refers to the lightness or darkness of the hue.

- The First property of color is called <b>hue</b>. This simply refers to the name of the color
- <b>Intensity</b> (complementary colors): This refers to the saturation of a color.
- Mixing black or white with a color changes its value and at the same time affects it intensity.
- <b>Mixtures Lower intensity</b>: One way to lower the intensity of a color is to mix gray with the or mix it with its complement (a color directly across from it on the color wheel).
- In <i>paint</i> mixtures, complements neutralize towards grey or black (a subtractive mixture).
- In <i>light</i> mixture, complements mix to produce white light (additive mixture). Still known as a neutralization.

### Mixing Light and mixing pigments.

- Optical Mixture: Placing pure colors side by side in small areas so that on observation, the viewer's eyes do the mixing.

### Color Schemes

- Monochromatic Color Schemes: Involves the use of only one hue with variance in value. Black and white might be added to the mix.
- Analogous color scheme: This involves the use of several hues that sit next to each other on the color wheel.
- Tonality: Tonality refers to the dominance of a single color or the visual importance of a hue that seems to pervade the whole color structure despite the presence of other colors. <b>Analogous color</b> schemes can produce a dominant tonality.
- Complementary/Triadic color scheme: As the term implies, this joins colors opposite each other on the color wheel. This combination produces a heightened sense of contrast.
- Split Complementary color scheme: Employs colors adjacent to one of the complementary color pairs.
- Triadic Color scheme; Involves the use of three hues equally spaced on the color wheel.

### Color Discord
  This is the opposite of color harmony. This could be employed to add interesting effects.

### Color Uses.
**Local, optical, Arbitrary**
- Local color is the color identified under ordinary day light. This is the objective color that we know objects are: grass is green, banana is yellow.
