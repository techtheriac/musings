# What is a Cateory

> A Category is a two-sorted structure that encodes the algebra of composition.

It has:

- Objects A, B, C .... and
- Arrows A -> B, B -> C each with a specified source and target.

- Category theory through its universal constructions provides the very semantics of interconnection, configuration, instantiation and, composition.
