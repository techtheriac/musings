## Linear Data Structures:

Operations on Array and the BigO - Insert at end: O(1) - Constant - Insert at begining: O(n) - Linear - Insert generally: O(n) - Linear - Remove from end: O(1) - Constant - Remove generally: O(n) - Linear - Find Value: O(n) - Linear - Access value: O(1) - Constant

    > Finding a value differs from accessing a value in the sense that in accessinga value, an address (index) is already provided, making it a constant time operation.
