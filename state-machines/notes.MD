## A Finite State Machine

Is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.
A Finite State Machine can change from one state to another in response to some external stimuli.
The change from one state to another is called a transition.
A finite state machine is defined by a list of its state, its initial state, and conditions for each transition.

> A STATE is the description of the status of a system that is waiting to execute a transition.
