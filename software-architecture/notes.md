### Three-tier architecture.
  Three-tier architecture pattern is a software architecture pattern in which user interface (presentation), functional process logic and computer data storage and data access are developed and maintained as independent modules.

### A Monolithic application
  This is one where the user interface and data access code are combined into a single program on a single platform. A monolithic application is self contained.


### Microservices
    Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:
    - Highly maintainable and testable
    - Loosely coupled
    - Independently deployable
    - Organized around business capabilities
    - Owned by a small team.
    A microservice architecture allows rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables are organization to evolve its technology stack.
